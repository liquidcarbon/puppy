# This is the installation Bash script for Puppy.

# IMPORTANT: pup will never touch or modify your system python.
# Except for Pixi, nothing is permanently placed on PATH.
# The base python installation and all virtual environments will
# reside in one folder, the one from which you call this script.

# From a folder that will become your pup/python home, call:

# curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.sh

# This script checks for the tools that pup requires and installs or updates them.
# It will ask for the desired python version and use the latest versions of the other tools.

# 1) pixi (see https://pixi.sh to learn more about Pixi)
# 2) base python (strictly one per pup/py home)
# 3) uv (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv to learn more about uv)
# 4) click (see https://github.com/pallets/click to learn more about click)
# 5) pup.py

# In the final step, the script will export an alias "pup" pointed to "./pup.py".
# This alias is not permanent, by design, to easily between different base pup/pythons.
# Whenever you open a new terminal, simply call this script again to recreate the alias.
# Running this script from another folder will setup/activate another pup/python base.
# If another base python is needed, simply run this script again from another folder.
# Though it may work, it is not recommended to nest pup/py folders.

# A pup/py home is defined by one and only one python executable, which is managed by pixi,
# along with tools like uv, jupyter, hatch, pytest, and conda-managed packages.
# We use home-specific tools through a pixi shell from anywhere within the folder,
# e.g. `pixi run python`, `pixi run jupyter`, or by calling their absolute paths.

# The blueprint for a pup/py home is in `pixi.toml`; at this level, git is not needed.
# The inner folders are git-ready project environments managed by pup and uv.
# In each of the inner folders, there is a classic `.venv` folder populated by uv, and
# a `pyproject.toml` file that is kept in sync with the environment by pup.
