## What does puppy do?

TLDR: `pup fetch` <-> `pip install`.  But wait, there's more!

There is a script called `pup`.  It's a cute little wrapper around **[pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi)** and **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**, two modern and powerful Rust-based tools that complement each other.

### [LOL WHY](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/discussions/1)?

## Get started

To start, you need only `curl`/`iwr`; pup and friends will handle the rest.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.sh | bash
```

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.ps1 | iex  # coming soon
```

## Then what?

Coming soon

## Future
- `pup build` (via compile, freeze, etc.)
- `pup swim` (build [Dockerfiles](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liquidcarbon/pup-fileserver))


## Past
- the [first iteration](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/tree/b474b1cd6c63b9fc80db5d81f954536a58aeab2a) was a big Bash script
