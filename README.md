# Puppy

Your new best friend will help you set up python, with a little help from some powerful friends.

## What does puppy do?

TLDR: `pup fetch` <-> `pip install`.  But wait, there's more!

There is a script called `pup`.  It's a cute little wrapper around **[pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi)** and **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**, two modern and powerful Rust-based tools that complement each other.

### [LOL WHY](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/discussions/1)?

## Get started

To start, you need only `curl`/`iwr`; pup and friends will handle the rest.

The first command installs Pixi, Pup, and Python.
The second command creates alias `pup` in the current shell by sourcing the last line of the install script (do inspect the last line to ensure you trust it).

### Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.sh | bash
```

```bash
. <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.sh | tail -1)
```

### Windows

```powershell
iex (iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.ps1).Content
```

```powershell
iex ((iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.ps1).Content -split "`n")[-1]
```
> [!TIP] 
> Do inspect that last line to ensure you trust it.

### Check Installation
With `pup` alias:

```bash
$ pup which
[2024-05-13 18:54:12] üê∂ says: home is /mnt/c/Users/a/Desktop/code/puppy513
```

```powershell
PS C:\Users\a\puppytest> pup which
[2024-05-13 18:48:16] üê∂ says: home is C:\Users\a\puppytest
```

> [!NOTE] 
> If you don't set the `pup` alias, Bash `./pup.py` will work thanks to a shebang; but for Powershell you'll have to find python executable and run `.\.pixi\envs\default\python.exe pup.py which`.


### Install specific python version
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.sh | bash -s 3.11
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/main/pup.ps1).Content)) 3.11
```

## Then what?

Coming soon

## Future
- `pup build` (via compile, freeze, etc.)
- `pup swim` (build [Dockerfiles](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liquidcarbon/pup-fileserver))


## Past
- the [first iteration](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy/tree/b474b1cd6c63b9fc80db5d81f954536a58aeab2a) was a big Bash script
