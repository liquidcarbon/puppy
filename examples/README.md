## DuckDB Query Editor in Gradio ([source](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liquidcarbon/duckdb-fastapi-gradio/tree/main), [app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liquidcarbon/duckdb-fastapi-gradio))

[Interactive SQL query editor](https://medium.com/@liquidc/live-duckdb-editor-on-gradio-533addd0666c):
- accepts variables to use in query templates
- saves queries and their execution data into an internal database (simply a JSON file)
- displays results as an interactive table that can be sorted and filtered
- creates shareable links, for query editor and results
- works on mobile (for those who always wanted to practice SQL on the toilet)

[One notebook, many environments](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/discussions/2994) - no more Jupyter kernels!
Uses a cool trick (if I can say so myself) to inject dependencies into a python script at launch time.
